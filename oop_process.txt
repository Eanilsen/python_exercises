1. Write or draw about the problem.
2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.
3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
5. Repeat and refine.

Make a list of all the nouns and verbs in your writing and drawings, then write
out how they are related. (CRC?)
Nouns = classes
Verbs = functions

Simple game engine example:

Write or draw about the problem.
Death
    This is when the player dies and should be something funny.
Central Corridor
    This is the starting point and has a Gothon already standing there they have
    to defeat with a joke before continuing.
Laser Weapon Armory
    This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up the ship before getting
    to the escape pod. It has a keypad the hero has to guess the number for.
The Bridge
    Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.
Escape Pod
    Where the hero escapes but only after guessing the right escape pod.
